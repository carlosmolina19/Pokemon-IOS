# Pok√©dex README

## Overview
This project is built on a protocol-oriented MVVM architecture, embracing SOLID principles and Clean Architecture. It's designed for modern iOS application development, incorporating technologies like Combine, CoreData, and SwiftUI. This approach ensures scalability and maintainability while delivering high-performance applications.

## Architecture

### MVVM
Our architecture leverages the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) pattern, emphasizing the separation of presentation logic from business logic. The use of protocols plays a vital role, ensuring flexibility and component decoupling.

### SOLID Principles
We adhere to SOLID principles, guiding our design and architectural decisions. This adherence fosters clean, maintainable, and extendable code, preparing our system for future changes and expansions.

## Design Patterns

- **Repository:** Manages data operations, providing a clean separation and abstraction of data sources.
- **Factory:** Used for creating objects without specifying the exact class of the object that will be created.
- **Builder:** Simplifies the construction of complex objects, providing clarity and flexibility.

## Technologies

- **Combine:** Handles asynchronous event processing, reacting to data changes reactively.
- **CoreData:** Our choice for data persistence, enabling efficient and robust data management.
- **SwiftUI:** Used for building declarative, modern, and reactive user interfaces.

## Dependencies

- **MockingBird:** Facilitates unit testing by creating mock objects and verifying code interactions.
- **Nuke:** Efficient image management, enhancing performance and user experience.

## Folder Structure

- **Data Persistence:** Contains logic related to data persistence, including CoreData integration.
- **View:** Houses UI components and visual presentation, built using SwiftUI.
- **ViewModel:** Includes ViewModels managing the presentation logic and state of views.
- **UseCases:** Contains business logic specific to the domain, bridging data layer and ViewModels.
- **Model:** Defines data models used across the system.
- **Networking:** Encompasses network communication logic and interactions with external services.

## Opportunities for Improvement

- **Add Missing Tests:** Increase test coverage to ensure code stability and quality.
- **Add Localizable File:** Implement localization to support multiple languages and regions.
- **Integrate Fastlane:** Automate common tasks.
- **CI Integration (GitHub Actions or CircleCI):** Establish continuous integration to automate building and testing.
